How will you get historical data to train the model? E.g., you probably want a year's worth of data mentioning each company, so you can fit a regression model with stock market value. How many different companies will you consider? Will you fit a separate model for each company, or just one model for all? How will you evaluate? You probably want a regression model instead of a classification model, unless you're classifying "up or down". You'll also want to include some simple baselines -- e.g., regression based on the past N stock values.
